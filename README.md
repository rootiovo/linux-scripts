## Future Features and Improvements 🚀

NixToolKit is continuously evolving, and we have exciting plans to enhance its capabilities. Here's what's on the horizon:

### 1. **APT Package for Easy Installation** 📦
- We're working on packaging NixToolKit as an APT package 📦, making it straightforward to install on Debian-based systems. This will streamline the installation process and make the toolkit more accessible.

### 2. **Robust Command Line Interface (CLI)** 💻
- An improved CLI experience is in the works, utilizing libraries like `argparse` or `click` to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction. Expect better help menus, clear command descriptions, and convenient subcommands for diverse tools.

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation** 📚
- We plan to extend our documentation to cover each tool in detail, including practical use cases and examples. The goal is to make the documentation a valuable resource for both beginners and advanced users.

### 4. **Automated Testing and CI/CD Integration** 🛠️
- Ensuring the reliability and stability of NixToolKit is a priority. We're implementing automated testing 🧪 and integrating CI/CD pipelines for consistent quality and seamless updates.

### 5. **Community Engagement and Contribution Process** 👥
- Community feedback and contributions are the lifeblood of open-source projects. We aim to foster community engagement by streamlining the contribution process and actively seeking user feedback for continuous improvement.

### 6. **Cross-Distribution Compatibility** 🌍
- Our goal is to make NixToolKit universally compatible with various Linux distributions, not just Debian-based ones. Efforts to create RPM packages and other distribution-specific versions are underway.

### 7. **Interactive Features and Guided Mode** 👆
- To make NixToolKit more approachable to newcomers, we're planning to introduce interactive features and a guided mode. These additions will help users who are new to Unix/Linux systems navigate the toolkit with ease.

### 8. **Your Suggestions** 💡
- We're open to ideas and suggestions from the community! If you have a feature request or an idea for improvement, please let us know by opening an issue on our [GitHub Issues](link_to_github_issues) page.
